## Federated Learning

### Overview

Federated Learning is a machine learning approach that enables training algorithms across decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging the data itself. This paradigm is particularly relevant for Web3 applications where data privacy and decentralization are paramount.

### Key Concepts

#### Definition

Federated Learning allows multiple parties to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus addressing critical issues like data privacy, data security, and access rights.

#### Core Components

- **Client Devices**: Local devices that hold private data
- **Central Server**: Coordinates the training process and aggregates model updates
- **Global Model**: The shared model that benefits from distributed learning
- **Local Models**: Individual models trained on local data

### Architecture Patterns

#### Horizontal Federated Learning

- Participants share the same feature space but different data samples
- Common in scenarios with similar data structures across participants
- Example: Multiple hospitals training on patient data with similar medical records

#### Vertical Federated Learning

- Participants share the same sample space but different feature spaces
- Useful when different organizations have different attributes for the same entities
- Example: Bank and e-commerce platform combining financial and behavioral data

#### Federated Transfer Learning

- Participants have different data and feature spaces
- Leverages transfer learning techniques in federated settings
- Applicable when data distributions vary significantly across participants

### Web3 Applications

#### Decentralized AI Networks

- **Token-Incentivized Learning**: Participants earn tokens for contributing to model training
- **DAO-Governed Models**: Decentralized autonomous organizations manage model development
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Analyze blockchain data without exposing individual transactions

#### Blockchain Integration

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Ensure model update integrity through blockchain verification
- **Decentralized Model Marketplaces**: Trade trained models in decentralized marketplaces

### Implementation Considerations

#### Privacy Preservation

- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to model updates to protect individual privacy
- **Secure Aggregation**: Aggregate model updates without revealing individual contributions
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Perform computations on encrypted data

#### Communication Efficiency

- **Model Compression**: Reduce communication overhead through model compression techniques

- **Selective Participation**: Choose optimal subsets of participants for each round

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Non-IID Data

### Code Example (Simplified)

```python
class FederatedLearningClient:
    def __init__(self, local_data, model_architecture):
        self.local_data = local_data
        self.model = model_architecture

    def local_train(self, global_weights, epochs=5):
        self.model.set_weights(global_weights)
        self.model.fit(self.local_data, epochs=epochs)
        return self.model.get_weights()

## Self-supervised Learning

### Overview

Self-supervised learning is a paradigm where models learn representations from unlabeled data by solving pretext tasks that are automatically derived from the data itself. This approach is crucial for Web3 applications where labeled data might be scarce or expensive to obtain.

**Limitations**:

- Misleading for imbalanced datasets
- Doesn't provide insight into specific error types

#### Precision

**Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positive instances.

**Formula**: Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

**Use Cases**:

- When false positives are costly
- Spam detection in decentralized messaging
- Identifying high-value NFTs

**Web3 Applications**:

- Smart contract vulnerability detection
- Identifying legitimate DeFi protocols
- Filtering authentic social media profiles

#### Recall (Sensitivity)

**Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total actual positive instances.

- Security threat detection

**Web3 Applications**:

- Detecting all fraudulent transactions
- Identifying all potential security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive community moderation

#### F1 Score

**Definition**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.

**Formula**: F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

**Use Cases**:

- When both precision and recall are important
- Comparing models with different precision-recall trade-offs

**Variants**:

- **F-beta Score**: Weighted harmonic mean allowing emphasis on precision or recall

#### ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)

**Definition**: Measures the ability of a binary classifier to distinguish between classes across all threshold settings.

**Components**:

- **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: Sensitivity/Recall
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: 1 - Specificity

**Interpretation**:

- AUC = 1.0: Perfect classifier
- AUC = 0.5: Random classifier
- AUC < 0.5: Worse than random (can be inverted)

**Use Cases**:

- Binary classification problems
- Comparing models regardless of classification threshold
- Imbalanced datasets (with caution)

### Regression Metrics

- Can be negative for very poor models

### Multi-class Classification Metrics

#### Confusion Matrix

A table showing actual vs predicted classifications for each class.

**Components**:
