# Web3 Core Concepts

## Blockchain

**Definition**: A blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) that are linked and secured using cryptography.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Immutability**: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without network consensus
- **Transparency**: All transactions are visible to network participants
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure
- **Consensus**: Network participants agree on the validity of transactions

**Types of Blockchains**:

- **Public**: Open to everyone (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- **Private**: Restricted access (Enterprise solutions)
- **Consortium**: Semi-decentralized, controlled by a group
- **Hybrid**: Combination of public and private elements

**Real-world Applications**: Cryptocurrency, supply chain tracking, digital identity, voting systems
