# 🎯 Invested Capital Fix - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved
**Problem**: The "Invested Capital" metric in the portfolio overview was displaying $0.00 instead of the actual amount invested in active trading bots.

**Root Cause**: The `totalInitialFunds` property was being referenced in the UI (lines 278 and 471 of PortfolioOverview.js) but was never calculated in the `preparedData` useMemo hook.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `PortfolioOverview.js`:

1. **Added calculation for total invested capital**:
   ```javascript
   // Calculate total initial funds invested in active bots
   let totalInitialFunds = 0;
   if (account.bots && Array.isArray(account.bots)) {
     account.bots.forEach(bot => {
       if (bot.status === 'active') {
         totalInitialFunds += bot.allocated_fund || 0;
       }
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Added `totalInitialFunds` to the return object**:
   ```javascript
   return {
     totalValue: totalValue || 0,
     pnlAmount: pnlAmount || 0,
     pnlPercent: pnlPercent || 0,
     totalInitialFunds: totalInitialFunds || 0,  // ← Added this line
     allocations: allocations.length > 0 ? allocations : mockData.allocations,
   };
   ```

## 📊 Test Results

### Backend Test ✅
- **Current Account Status**: 
  - Balance: $90,000.00
  - Active Bots: 1 bot with $10,000.00 invested
  - **Total Invested Capital**: $10,000.00

### Frontend Logic Test ✅
- **Expected Display**: 
  - Total Value: $99,977.94
  - Invested Capital: $10,000.00 (previously $0.00)
  - PnL: -$22.06 (-0.02%)

## 🎉 Verification Results

### Before Fix:
```
Invested Capital: $0.00  ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Invested Capital: $10,000.00  ✅
```

## 📋 Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/components/portfolio/PortfolioOverview.js`
- **Lines Changed**: Added calculation logic around line 120 and updated return statement around line 160
- **Data Source**: Uses `bot.allocated_fund` from each active bot in `account.bots`
- **Scope**: Only counts bots with `status === 'active'`

## 🔍 Testing Performed

1. **Backend API Test**: Verified account data structure contains `allocated_fund` field
2. **Frontend Calculation Test**: Confirmed JavaScript logic works correctly
3. **Integration Test**: Verified end-to-end calculation with live data
4. **Syntax Check**: No TypeScript/JavaScript errors introduced

## 🚀 Impact

- ✅ Users can now see the actual amount they have invested in active trading strategies
- ✅ Portfolio overview provides accurate financial metrics
- ✅ Improved user confidence in the platform's transparency
- ✅ Consistent with the rest of the portfolio metrics display

## 📝 Notes

- The fix only considers `active` bots to avoid including stopped/paused strategies
- The calculation safely handles cases where no bots exist (defaults to $0.00)
- The implementation follows the existing code patterns in the file
- No breaking changes to the existing UI or data flow
